This example demonstrates a common misunderstanding when using mutable variables within functions in F#.  The `swap` function attempts to swap the values of `x` and `y`. However, because F# functions are lexically scoped the parameters `x` and `y` are copies of the values in the main scope, instead of references. Therefore, changing the parameters within `swap` does not affect the global mutable variables `x` and `y`.
